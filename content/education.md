The point of this page is to show off my education. However, I haven't graduated high school yet.
I have done the following (somewhat) relevant classes:

- Foundations of AI
- Algebra 2 Honors
- Applied Engineering Design
- Chemistry

## Future Plans?

I'd like to go to MIT (top pick), Harvard (second pick), Northwestern (third pick)
What I want to major in is still a mystery to me, but here's a few I'm looking at:

- Computer Science Major 
- Law/Criminal Justice Major (To become a lawyer)
- Business/Marketing Major

## Years of High School to come?

While I am only a freshman (9th grade), set to graduate as class of 2028, I do know a few classes I'd like to do are:

- Data Structures
- Software Engineering
- Business and Marketing Honors
- IB Marketing

As well as obtain not one, not two, but three diplomas upon graduating:

- High School Graduation Diploma
- STEM Diploma
- IB Diploma 

## Any Industry Certifications?

I'm proud to say that, I do have multiple industry certifications, such as:

- CS50P Certificate of Completion
- PCEP Certified Beginner Python Programmer

And hopefully, more to come!
